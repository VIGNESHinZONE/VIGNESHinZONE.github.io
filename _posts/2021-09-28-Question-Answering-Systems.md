## Background

In the Fall of 2022, I had taken the CS528-NLP and as part of this course, we supposed to work on course projects. I will using this post to document my learning on Question Answering Systems.

As part of this project we try explore the diffrent benchmarks as part of [SQuAD 2.0](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) dataset.

## Notes from Chapter [23- Question Answering](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/)

In following section, lets look into the details given about Question Answering systems from [Speech and Language Processing](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/) book by Dan Jurafsky.


## Blogs I would like to explore - 

1. [Building a Question-Answering System from Scratchâ€” Part 1](https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-question-answering-system-part-1-9388aadff507)

She uses sentence embeddings, to find similarity with context & question. She also explores stratergy, parse tree of a sentence is used for getting the answers. And also unsupervised stratergies mentioned.


2. [Building a Question Answering model](https://towardsdatascience.com/nlp-building-a-question-answering-model-ed0529a68c54)

Again uses attention vectors in LSTM & explores BiDAF model

3. [Build a Trivia Bot using T5 Transformer](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/build-a-trivia-bot-using-t5-transformer-345ff83205b6)

Explains the 3 diffrent types of QA systems. She talks about 3 stratergies where
    - Compress all the information in the weight parameters. T5 model here
    - For very long context (databases of documents), here we find top-k documents.

4. [Implementing QANet (Question Answering Network) with CNNs and self attentions
](https://towardsdatascience.com/implementing-question-answering-networks-with-cnns-5ae5f08e312b)

Im yet to read this and it probably uses CNN.

## Papers/repo I would like to explore - 

1. [Question Answering on SQuAD](https://github.com/BAJUKA/SQuAD-NLP)
2. [Probably uses huggingace directly for QA](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/main/tutorials/nlp/Question_Answering_Squad.ipynb#scrollTo=n8HZrDmr12_-)
3. [CS 224N Default Final Project: Question Answering](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1184/default_project/default_project_v2.pdf)
4. [BiDAF Model for Question Answering](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1174/reports/2760988.pdf)
